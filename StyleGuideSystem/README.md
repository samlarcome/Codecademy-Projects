# CodeCademy-StyleGuideSystem

## Project Goals:

The goal of this project is to build your own basic design system for a website. "In essence, you’ll be building a website to help you build MORE websites in the future! On your site, you’ll collect all the colors, fonts, and some of the repeating styles."

## Project Requirements

We'll build a style guide/design system for your website. Design systems are used in order to organize the look and feel of a website or web application. Design systems help to document the visual vocabulary and reusable components of a large website.

As websites grow larger and more complex, having a consistent set of styles is important. It also helps as you start working with other developers, as you can have a consistent reference for how your website should be built.

"Your style guide/design system will include at least a section on colors, fonts, and specific text styles, but it can be extended to as many other areas as you’d like. You can take a look at our basic example site for a taste of what you’ll be building"


## Thoughts

This was a challenge project after learning some CSS styling in the Full Stack Engineer course on Codecademy. I find it easier to learn while doing so this was a great way to put some of the HTML and CSS that I have learned over the past few days.
