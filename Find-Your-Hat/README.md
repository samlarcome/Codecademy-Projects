# Challenge Project: Find Your Hat

# Overview
  "This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus far on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project you’ll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve."

# Project Goals
  "In this project, you’ll be building an interactive terminal game. The scenario is that the player has lost their hat in a field full of holes, and they must navigate back to it without falling down one of the holes or stepping outside of the field"

## How it Works
  The game can be started by running the program via the terminal. ```node main.js``` will start the program. It will provide the user with a picture of the field and essentially ask where the user wants to move. They have four choices:  
  + u = up
  + d = down
  + l = left
  + r = right  

The goal is to find the hat ```^``` in the field without going out of bounds or falling down a hole ```o```

## Thoughts
  This was a fun little first project using Node. I did not expect to face many challenges, but I am glad I did and was able to work through them.
