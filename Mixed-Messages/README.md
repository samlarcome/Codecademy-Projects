# Mixed Messages

## Project Description

 "For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. Youâ€™re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to your liking."

## Project Objectives
  - Build a message generator program using JavaScript
  - Use Git Version Control
  - Use command line
  - Develope locally on computer

## Notes
  - I love Star Wars, so I decided to take some inspiration from that
  - This project did not require any html or css, but I felt it would be more challenging to work on one
  - Created a very basic html/css design for this project
